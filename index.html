                <h1>Jazz</h1>
            </header>
            <div>
                <p>A music created mainly by black Americans in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century through an amalgamation of elements drawn from European-American and tribal African musics. A unique type, it cannot safely be categorized as folk, popular, or art music, though it shares aspects of all three. It has had a profound effect on international culture, not only through its considerable popularity, but through the important role it has played in shaping the many forms of popular music that developed around and out of it.</p>
            </div>
            <section id="a">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The attraction of jazz, as with any music, lies in its particular combination of rhythm, melody, harmony, instrumental sound, and the like. But three distinctive characteristics of jazz have given it a special appeal. One is the phenomenon of swing (see <a href="">§§II</a>, <a href="">5</a>, and <a href="">IV</a>, <a href="">1&ndash;2</a>, below; see also <a href="">Swing (i)</a>). The second is what may be called "individual code" — those subtle factors that make a jazz player instantly recognizable to knowledgeable listeners. Although some players can be identified by their ways of shaping melody, with most the individual code is expressed in more subtle qualities such as timbre, sharpness of attack, length of decay, vibrato, pitch variations, and various distortions produced by throat tones, mutes, and other techniques and devices. The individual code is an important part of the communication between player and listener, and has to be taken into account in any discussion of a jazz musician's work. The third important characteristic of jazz is its ecstatic function. Jazz usually takes place in the context of an actual or simulated <a href="">Jam Session</a>, which has some aspects of a ritual. The players do not merely reproduce prescribed sequences of notes, they participate in a sort of ceremony in which they interact with the audience and one another, somewhat as a preacher interacts with he congregation at a "sanctified" church. As in any ritual there are certain forms of behavior to be observed: players are expected not to push themselves at one another's expense; audiences are permitted, indeed encouraged, to become part of the ceremony by dancing, stamping their feet, or offering cries of encouragement or bursts of applause. The relations to West African dance ceremonies, and the practices of the black-American churches, which descended form them, is obvious. These three elements are probably present to some degree in all musical performances, but in jazz they are central, almost indispensable. A jazz performance that lacked any of them would not be rated highly by most jazz enthusiasts.</p>

            <section id="b">
                <h2>Origins and early history</h2>
                <p>The genesis of jazz was a three-stage process: first, the development, in the 18th and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, of an indigenous black folk music out of African and European-American elements; second, the rise out of this music of subforms, notably plantation and minstrel songs, ragtime, and blues; third, the appearance of jazz itself, from an imperfectly understood merging of blues, ragtime, and mainstream popular music.</p>
                <h3 id="b1">African background</h3>
                <p>Black slaves, the bulk of them from West Africa, were imported into the New World by the hundreds of thousands from the 16th century. The music of these people varied from one cultural group to another, but all of it shared certain characteristics. It was in the main functional, intended to accompany religious ceremonies and ecstatic dancing, to inspire hunters, to make work easier, and even to celebrated minor events such as the appearance of a child's first tooth; and it was woven into the culture, forming a part of ordinary living almost as ubiquitous as speech.</p>
                <h3 id="b2">Plantation songs, ragtime, the blues</h3>
                <p>The second stage in the evolution of jazz began as the black folk music of the 19<sup>th</sup> century generated other forms, which worked their way into the mainstream of popular music, not only in the USA but also elsewhere int he world. White Americans have always been interested in, indeed fascinated by, the black subculture in their midst, and on manifestation of this fascination has been an interest in black music. Early in the 19<sup>th</sup> century Whites began producing songs supposedly in the manner of the Blacks' plantation music. Many such :plantation songs: were incorporated in the minstrel shows that were vastly popular during much of the century; they were heavily "Europeanized" — imbued with the harmonic and other stylistic elements of European-American music — and suggested true black folk music only through the use of plagal cadences, frequently implied by extensive use of the sixth degree of the scale, and occasional syncopations, specially the prototype rhythm shown in ex.1.</p>
                <h3 id="b3">The creation of jazz</h3>
                <p>Jazz itself evolved from the fusion of black folk forms such as ragtime and blues with various popular musics. The earliest is generally known as <a href="">New Orleans Jazz</a>, since New Orleans has been traditionally regarded as the birthplace of jazz. Writers of a later period revised this view, insisting that jazz evolved more generally throughout the South and pointing particularly to the Southwest; however, the pioneer jazz musicians, both those from New Orleans and those from elsewhere, invariably said that jazz came from that city. Why jazz crystallized in New Orleans is obscure, but several factors seem to have made the city unique.</p>
                <h3 id="b4">Prototypes of the jazz band</h3>
                <p>By 1900 there existed in New Orleans a large number of black and Creole bands playing many kinds of music. At least four general types of band are evident (see also <a href="">Bands, §4(i)</a>). A few of the more skilled groups, such as those led by John Robichaux and A. J. Piron, were playing arrangements of waltzes, quadrilles, and sentimental ballads, and, inevitably, ragtime in places such as Lincoln Park (patronized by Blacks) and in elegant restaurants and clubs frequented by wealthy Whites.</p>
                <h3 id="b5">The emergence of hot music</h3>
                <p>The black bands in New Orleans played a highly varied body of music, much of it inflected with elements drawn from 19<sup>th</sup>-century black music. Probably shortly after the turn of the century, the ingredients combined in a novel way to product a new kind of music. Even at the time few people grasped the exact nature or cause of this change, but throughout the first decade of the century there was a growing recognition that a new type of music ad been born. It was not at first called jazz: the musicians referred to their music as ragtime, and spoke of "playing hot".</p>
                <h3 id="b6">New Orleans jazz musicians</h3>
                <p>The man generally credited with being the first jazz musician is Buddy Bolden (fig.1); it is almost certain, however, that he played not jazz but ragtime and the blues, though perhaps with traces of the new jazz feeling. After Bolden came a cadre of players eager to try their hands at the new music, though little is known of many of them except their names, a few dates, the names of their bands, and a number of anecdotes.</p>

            <section id="c">
                <h2>The spread of jazz</h2>
                <h3 id="c1">Jazz enters the cultural mainstream</h3>
                <p>Jazz did not spread over the USA solely on the strength of its own merits, but as part of a profound social upheaval that shook American culture in the years between 1890 and 1920. In the 1890s an old American ethic of hard work and emotional constraint began to shatter before a new ideal that emphasized pleasure and self-expression as acceptable routes to personal well-being. This shift in the American ethic led to the development of new institutions: dance halls, cabarets, opulent restaurants, and theaters. Although such institutions had long existed in less elegant form in the underworld districts such as New York's Tenderloin, in bohemian areas such as San Francisco's Barbary Coast, and in black ghettoes, around the turn of the century middle-class Whites adopted them, made them respectable and integrated them into the mainstream of American culture. This process whereby art forms spawned in the subculture are gradually expurgated and accepted into the mainstream has repeated itself many times in 20<sup>th</sup>-century American life: it occurred in the case of ragtime, developed in the black brothels and saloons specially around St. Louis, and with such dances as the turkey trot and the charleston, which evolved in low bars; the cabaret and cinema achieved respectability in the second decade of the century, and jazz became respectable int he 1920s.</p>
                <h3 id="c2">The dissemination from New Orleans</h3>
                <p>Jazz began to spread out from New Orleans almost simultaneously with the rise of the dance boom. Undoubtedly the first jazz musicians to leave were those who joined black vaudeville minstrel shows as they passed through the city. The first authentic black jazz band known to have made a mark outside New Orleans was organized by Bill Johnson (i), who left for California in 1908. His group, the Original Creole Band, toured on the vaudeville, circuits, and in 1915 played in a Broadway review called Town Topics; although in made no great impression, it helped to encourage other jazz musicians to leave New Orleans.</p>
                <h3 id="c3">Armstrong and Beiderbecke</h3>
                <p>Another service Oliver performed for the development of jazz was his sponsorship of Louis Armstrong, who had grown up in New Orleans and served a rough apprenticeship there in the honky-tonks. In 1922 Oliver brought Armstrong to Chicago to join his Creole Jazz Band. Here he was seen only as a member of the band, but in the 1924 he joined Fletcher Henderson's orchestra in New York as a jazz specialist (fig.2); he was given ample solo space, both on recordings and in performances at the segregated Roseland Ballroom, the band's principal venue.</p>
                <h3 id="c4">The rise of symphonic jazz</h3>
                <p>Even as the New Orleans style was becoming widely popular, others, principally <a href="">Ferde Grofé</a>, were developing a new approach to jazz. Grofé received a thorough education in classical music and began playing piano in dance halls, theaters, and brothels at an early age. In about 1914 he formed an alliance with the drummer Art Hickman, who led a dance band at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco.</p>
                <h3 id="c5">Stride and blues piano</h3>
                <p>Because the piano can function without accompaniment, it has evolved as a jazz instrument to some degree independently of the rest of the jazz band. Early on there were two lines of development. One was the evolution out of ragtime of the stride style (see <a href="">Piano, §2</a>). Stride involves the alternation of chords and single notes (or octaves) in the left hand and the rapid, pianistic figures typical of ragtime in the right.</p>
                <h3 id="c6">Jazz in the entertainment industry and the press</h3>
                <p>By the second half of the 1920s jazz was no longer a specialty music confined to honky-tonks, parties, and low cabarets but a popular music tightly enmeshed in a thoroughly commercial entertainment business that was to a considerable extent dominated by organized crime. The musicians who made the classic New Orleans jazz recordings earned their livelihood in dance and show bands in cabarets, theaters, and dance halls, and also on vaudeville stages; their music mostly fulfilled the function of an accompaniment to dancing or films or the backing for an act.</p>

            <section id="d">
                <h2>The big-band era</h2>
                <h3 id="d1">The rise of the big bands</h3>
                <p>During the years between about 1921 and 1926 symphonic jazz and New Orleans jazz were poised agains each other. Although initially symphonic jazz seemed to be more popular, by 1924 or 1925 it was becoming clear that a substantial number of Americans preferred a "hotter" type of arranged music than Whiteman and his imitators were providing. Several bandleaders responded to the demand for hot music, motivated not only by a concern for popularity but also by a preference for playing in what later come to be seen as the "true" style of jazz, rather than the "polite" style of Whiteman.</p>
                <h3 id="d2">Swing as a musical phenomenon</h3>
                <p>Because the sense of rhythm is so subjective, and because differences in timing of a 20<sup>th</sup> of a second can be critical, it is very difficult to analyze exactly the change that occurred in jazz rhythm in the big-band era. Jazz rhythms had grown out of the black musical practices of shading the melody away from the ground beat at some points, splitting the beat into two uneven parts, and undergirding two-beat ragtime with 4/4 time.</p>
                <h3 id="d3">The big-band boom</h3>
                <p>The big-band era, which extended roughly from 1929 to the mid-1940s, was characterized by two features: the distinctive ensemble that played written arrangements, and the modification of the jazz beat. But social factors also exercised an influence. One such was the economic depression following the crash of the stock market in 1929; this badly hurt the entertainment business in general and nearly destroyed the record industry, which was faced with free competition from the newly popular medium of radio.</p>
                <h3 id="d4">Small-group jazz</h3>
                <p>By far the largest part of the big-band jazz of the period from 1935 to 1945 was essentially commercial dance music, in which the jazz elements were considerably diluted. During the same period a much more serious-minded interpretation of swing was developed by small, informal jazz band, often put together for a brief club engagement or single recording session.</p>
                <h3 id="d5">Jazz spreads abroad</h3>
                <p>As early as 1919 the Original Dixieland Jazz Band made a tour of England, and during the 1920s a few other jazz musicians, most notably Sidney Bechet, spent time in Europe, either individually or with such touring show bands as that let by Sam Wooding. None of these musicians had much impact, however: the Original Dixieland Jazz Band's music perplexed listeners in London and received uniformly bad reviews, while Bechet and others aroused little interest.</p>
                <h3 id="d6">The growth of jazz criticism in the USA</h3>
                <p>In the 1930s, largely for reasons having to do with attitudes towards Blacks, the American left-wing press took up jazz as a subject, and from 1936 there began to appear in the New Republic, the New Masses, The Nation, and similar publications frequent review and discussions of jazz by such writers as Otis Ferguson, John Hammond, Charles Edward Smith, Bernard Haggin, and others.</p>
                <h3 id="d7">The New Orleans revival</h3>
                <p>Many early jazz critics, in part for political reasons, disdained the new swing music, which they saw as "commercial," and took the position that the only true jazz was that of the early black pioneers and their white followers, especially those from the Midwest. The effect was to create an appetite among many jazz fans, especially younger ones, for the older music, and this in turn made it economically feasible for recording companies to reissue earlier recordings.</p>

                <h2>Bop and modern jazz</h2>
                <h3 id="e1">The climate for change</h3>
                <p>By 1941, when the USA was drawn into World War II, big-band jazz was the dominant popular music of the country: there were hundreds of big bands, some 50 of which were nationally known, had large followings, recorded regularly, and worked in dance halls and theaters all the year round.</p>
                <h3 id="e2">Harmonic and rhythmic experiments</h3>
                <p>Gillespie seems to have been mainly responsible for introducing many of the harmonic devices that characterize bop.</p>
                <h3 id="e3">Further developments in the musical language</h3>
                <p>In 1940, just as Parker and Gillespie were making their first tentative experiments, a former musician named Henry Minton took over a small club in Harlem and asked the bandleader Teddy Hill to manage it.</p>
                <h3 id="e4">Bop piano</h3>
                <p>Once again the piano followed a somewhat independent line of development in the bop period.</p>
                <h3 id="e5">The commercial growth of Bop</h3>
                <p>The evolution of bop and its acceptance by fans was a rapid process.</p>
                <h3 id="e6">The cool school</h3>
                <p>Running parallel to bop from about the mid-1940s there was a movement, mainly among white musicians, to adopt more advanced harmonies and musical procedures suggested by European art music, especially that of Stravinsky and Debussy.</p>

                <p>During the late 1940s and early 1950s it seemed, from the success of the groups led by Herman, Kenton, Brubeck, and Mulligan, and a little later those of Davis and Lewis, that jazz would follow the "classical" road.</p>

                <h3 id="f1">The rise of free jazz</h3>
                <p>By 1960 the bop movement was declining.</p>
                <h3 id="f2">The modal alternative: Davis and Coltrane</h3>
                <p>Alongside free jazz, alternative approaches continued to be explored, among them Davis's modally based music.</p>
                <h3 id="f3">Further developments in free jazz</h3>
                <p>Free music never became the dominant mode in jazz in the same manner as did swing and bop, but it continued to develop alongside the mainstream.</p>
                <h3 id="f4">Jazz-rock</h3>
                <p>Possibly the most important impact on jazz of the 1960s and 1970s was that produced not by the avant garde, or any jazz musician at all, but by rock musicians.</p>
                <h3 id="f5">Explorations of new forms outside the USA</h3>
                <p>The majority of jazz musicians in the USA had initially been hostile towards avant-garde jazz, and most felt that jazz-rock was too commercial, and not really jazz at all.</p>
                <h3 id="f6">The resurgence of jazz in the USA</h3>
                <p>The 1970s saw a substantial improvement in the fortunes of jazz in the USA.</p>
                <h3 id="f7">Conclusions</h3>
                <p>Interest in jazz remains strong in the 1980s, though it has become extremely diffuse. In the past a single mode usually dominated the music — for instance, big-band swing prevailed in the 1930s, hard bop in the 1950s; in the 1980s it seems uncertain what path the music will take. There is, for example, a strong tendency for players, both young and old, to draw into their performances elements from extremely disparate sources. From the 1960s, following the lead of the Beatles, many jazz musicians, among them John McLaughlin and a number of free-jazz players, have attempted to incorporate effects from Indian music into their work. Other, such as Airto Moreira, have brought in elements from various South American forms, and Abdullah Ibrahim has introduced characteristic features of African music, This eclecticism is perhaps best seen in the work of Keith Jarrett, a pianist who was trained in the European-American concert tradition and came relatively late to jazz.</p>
